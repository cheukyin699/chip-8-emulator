Introduction
============

This shouldn't be too too difficult to follow. Let's start!


Building
========

Create a new directory to build the project. `mkdir build' should do just fine.
After this, execute the following commands:

    cd build        # Or the directory that you created
    cmake ..
    make

If all is successful, you will see 3 executables:

    Chip8_Assembler
    Chip8_Emulator
    Chip8_Disassembler


Running the Emulator
====================

Let's use one of the test programs to run on the emulator! As you can see in the
`c8games' directory, there are a ton of programs that you can play around with.
I will be using PONG2 for this example. To run PONG2, execute the command:

    ./Chip8_Emulator ../c8games/PONG2

Pretty straight-forward.
